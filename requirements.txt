# python_version 3.7.6
#
# The parse_version_from_requirements() function in the installPipfile.groovy
# file of the Jenkins Shared Library uses the python_version comment to set
# the version of python used.

# Distributed (released) dependencies
#
# The python modules listed below specify a known working combination required
# by the python code in this repository.  The procedure used to set up a
# suitable python environment for it installs the version of each module in
# the list.  Using a specific version ensures a controlled infrastructure for
# development, testing and release of this repository.
#
# Another repository might depend on python code defined in this one.  The
# procedure to set up a suitable python environment for that repository may
# pip-install this one as editable using this repository's setup.py file.  The
# same modules should appear in the setup.py list as given below.

# Development dependencies
#
# Each link listed below specifies the path to a setup.py file which are
# installed in editable mode with '-e $PATH' (without the quotes).
#
# If python code in this repository depends on python code under development
# in another repository, then an entry for that other respository should
# appear in this list instead of the released dependencies list.
#
# If this repository uses the setup functionality (e.g., script entry points)
# of its own setup.py file, then this list must include an entry for that
# setup.py file, e.g., '-e .' or '-e ./python' (without the quotes).
